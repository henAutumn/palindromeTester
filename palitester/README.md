A Palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards (ex: "civic", "radar", "taco-cat"). 
Clone this repository and create an app that will take a users input, and test to see if it is a palindrome. List the words that are and 
are not palindromes in separate lists, that update in realtime. 
Feel free to add more components if you think you need them. 

While building, consider these steps:
1) What is the goal of the application (What javascript tools will you need to use to accomplish this)?
2) Where will state, props or other tools of React help in making this challenge more efficient than vanilla javascript?
3) Is the current file setup of the application the most efficient? Is there a better way to set up the files to take advantage of class
   and functional components? Consider passing props as well. 
4) If you want more of a challenge, try creating a backend for this app, and save the
