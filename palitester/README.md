A Palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards (ex: "civic", "radar", "taco-cat"). 
Clone this repository and create an app that will take a users input, and test to see if it is a palindrome. List the words that are and 
are not palindromes in separate lists, that update in realtime. 
Feel free to add more components if you think you need them. 

While building, consider these steps:
1) What is the goal of the application (What javascript tools will you need to use to accomplish this)?
2) How will state, props or other tools of React help in checking the user's word more efficient than vanilla javascript?
3) What is the best way to present a list in React that can show updates in realtime? What does the list look like when there are no checked words yet? After several words have been checked?
4) Is the current file setup of the application the most efficient? Is there a better way to set up the files to take advantage of class
   and functional components? Consider passing props as well. 
5) If you want more of a challenge, try creating a Node Server for this app, and save the lists of Palindromes and NonPalidromes to two separate tables. 

You guys have all the tools you'll need to solve this, try walking through the escalation steps before asking for help! I purposely left this a little ambiguous, so it's up to you to find the best way you can figure out how to do something! 

Good Luck!
